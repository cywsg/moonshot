Thus, in order to make the Merger price  appear attractive to AMRI\u2019s outside \nstockholders, the defendants issued a proxy statement recommending approval of the Merger (the \n\"Proxy Statement\") that contained materially false and misleading information and omitted other \nmaterial information that wa s necessary to make the information that was disclosed not misleading.  \n5. Most notably, the financial projections contained in the Proxy Statement, and relied \nupon by the Board\u2019s financial advisor in opining that the Merger price was fair to stockholders, \nare inconsistent with the Company\u2019s true plans for growth, as shown by defendants\u2019 own prior \nstatements.  While the Company had told investors it would reach $1 billion in revenue within the \nnext few years, the projections used to justify the Merger forecast that the Company\u2019s revenue \nwould not have reached $1 billion even by the post -2021 \"terminal year.\"  These downwardly \nmanipulated financial projections were central to the Proxy Statement and to the Individual \nDefendants\u2019 advocacy of the Merger.  Projectio ns that were honest ( i.e. , showed higher growth) \nwould have made clear to stockholders that they would have been better off rejecting the Merger \nAgreement and either continuing to own AMRI as an independent public company or holding out \nfor a better offer.

Defendant ADT is an electronic security system company incorporated under the laws of Delaware.  ADT\u2019s history traces back to the American District Telegraph Company, formed in 1874 as a consortium of 57 telegraph operators.  After over a century in business and a series of acquisitions and mergers, ADT became a public company in September 2012.  Throughout its prior tenure as a public company, ADT characterized its business as a recurring revenue business, where approximately 90% of its revenue is generated from its multi-year customer contracts, and emphasized five key value drivers for its subscription-based business model: customer additions, costs to add a new customer (known as subscriber acquisition costs or \"SAC\"), average revenue per customer, costs incurred to provide service to customers, and customer tenure.  In May 2016, Defendant Apollo Global, a private equity firm, acquired ADT in a leveraged buyout, after which ADT became a privately owned company and thus ceased trading publicly.  Through the IPO, ADT was spun off by Apollo Global and again became a public corporation, trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"ADT.\"   21. Defendant Apollo Global is the private equity firm that took ADT private in a leveraged buyout in May 2016 and then quickly took ADT public again via the January 2018 IPO.
