(\"Commcorp\") one of a number of companies that amalgamated to form the appellant, which was formerly called Newcourt Financial Ltd.\n[2] Originally, there were several issues but the parties have settled all but two. After the remaining issues have been dealt with by the Court, counsel have agreed to prepare a draft judgment in which all of the issues are disposed of.\n[3] The remaining issues have to do with capital cost allowance (\"CCA\") on software acquired by Commcorp in 1993. The Minister of National Revenue characterized the series of transactions and each transaction within the series whereby Commcorp acquired the software and then leased it back ultimately to the person who had developed it and used it in its business as an avoidance transaction within the meaning of the General Anti-Avoidance Rule (\"GAAR\") and determined the tax consequences to Commcorp to be that it was not entitled to claim any CCA on the software.\n[4] The alternative position is that Commcorp acquired the software from a person with whom it was not dealing at arm's length and the cost to it should be reduced to the fair market value (\"fmv\"), which the respondent says was not greater than $13,100,000.\n[5] The appellant concedes that Commcorp acquired the software from a person with whom it was not dealing at arm's length, but contends that the value at the date of the acquisition was $33,091,255.\n...\n[75] The appeal is allowed and the reassessment is referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the software was acquired by Commcorp from 1004583 at its fair market value of Cnd.$13,100,000.\n[76] The parties are directed to prepare a draft judgment incorporating the conclusions stated in these reasons as well as any other matters in this litigation that they have settled.\n[77] Failing agreement on costs the parties should communicate with the Court to determine a suitable date for making representations.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada this 5th day of September, 2003.\n\"D.G.H.

The question concerns the tax consequences resulting from the sale of a property that was formerly owned by Mr. DePedrina's parents.\n[2] The property that was sold is a five acre parcel of land in Langley, British Columbia on which Mr. DePedrina's parents resided. In 1978, the parents signed and registered a deed in respect of the property, prepared by a firm of solicitors. Under this document, the property was transferred to Mr. DePedrina, his brother and their respective wives, with a life interest reserved to the parents. The parents did not tell the DePedrinas about the transfer before signing the deed and simply told them afterwards that \"their inheritance had been taken care of.\" Mr. DePedrina's brother constructed a home on the property and it became his principal residence along with the parents. Mr. DePedrina did not do this, out of deference to his parents.\n[3] Mr. DePedrina's father died in 1983 and his mother died in 1997. As a consequence, the life interest expired in 1997. In 1998, the children sold the property for a total consideration of $1,850,000.\n[4] The Minister of National Revenue issued assessments of tax to Mr. and Mrs. DePedrina in respect of the sale in 1998. Each was taxed in respect of a capital gain of $384,833. In the computation of the adjusted cost base, the Minister took into account the appraised value of the remainder interest in 1978.\n...\n[12] In my analysis, the taxpayers' understanding of the parents' intent cannot override the legal effect of the deed that the parents signed. In any event, I am not able to conclude on the evidence that the parents did not understand that the deed resulted in a legal transfer of the property. The deed was prepared by solicitors who should have been satisfied that the parents understood what they were signing. Further, it is clear that the parents intended to provide an inheritance for the children and that is in effect what the deed did.\n[13] Mr. and Mrs. DePedrina suggest that the parents would not have signed the deed if they had known the tax consequences of doing so. That may be so but it does not follow that the parents did not intend to transfer the property when they signed the deed in 1978.\n[14] As a result, I cannot give the relief that the taxpayers seek except to agree to the reduction in the capital gain conceded by the Crown. This would result in a reduction in the capital gain to each taxpayer in the amount of $17,500. The appeals will be allowed to that extent. As for costs, I have concluded that it is not appropriate to order costs in this case.\nSigned at Toronto, Ontario this 1st day of September, 2005.\n\"J. Woods\"\nWoods J.\n",

The investment managers have the discretionary power to manage the investment of the funds contained in the appellants reserve for claim.\n[3] The parties entered into a Partial Agreed Statement of Facts (ASF). It is attached as Schedule A to these reasons.\n[4] The ASF was supplemented by the evidence of two witnesses called by the appellant and one by the respondent.\n[5] The appellant is a not for profit body corporate. It provides professional liability protection for members of the medical profession as a mutual defence organization. It pays for the legal costs of defending doctors sued for malpractice and, if an award is made against a doctor, the appellant pays it. Despite its strong denials that it is an insurance company, it bears a striking resemblance to insurer except that it is not licensed and it says that, unlike an insurance company, it has no legal obligation to defend a doctor against whom a malpractice claim is made or to pay such a claim. This might come as something of a surprise to a physician who has paid substantial sums of money to the appellant for this sort of protection.\n[6] Physicians pay the appellant and the amounts received form part of CMPAs reserve for claims. The appellant retains the services of investment managers (IMs) who invest the appellants funds on a fully discretionary basis in two types of accounts: segregated funds and pooled funds.\n...\n[60] The GMCL case was factually far more complex than this case. In the case of CMPA it is clear beyond any doubt on the evidence that the IMs were not providing advice. It is equally clear that GMCL exercised a great deal of control over the decisions of the investment managers and relied upon the advice given to it by them. Justice Campbell made a finding of fact that the service was the providing of advice, albeit with expertise and skill. The finding that the IMs rendered advice to CMPA is not open to me on the evidence in this case.\n[61] The appeals are allowed with costs and the matter is referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reconsideration and reassessment on the basis that the fees paid to the IMs (except those which the appellant concedes are taxable) are exempt financial services.\n[62] To ensure that there are excluded from the operation of this judgment precisely the fees which the appellant has conceded are taxable, I am directing that the parties prepare a draft judgment and submit it to the Court within two weeks of the issuance of these reasons.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 10th day of April 2008.\nD.G.H.

The Appellant was the only witness.\n[2] The Appellant is an Investment Advisor employed by CIBC - Wood Gundy in Saskatoon and has been in that employment for over 15 years. He has appealed the disallowance of expenses claimed for his 1998 and 1999 taxation years. For 1998, $2,657.14 expenses remain in dispute (Exhibit A-4), and for 1999, $3881.97 remains in dispute (Exhibit A-5).\n[3] The Appellant was under oath. He is believed. In particular, he was frank about some expenses that he claimed which he insisted upon, such as donuts that he purchased on occasion by the dozen and dropped off in CIBC branch lunch rooms from which he was referred clients, and some other claimed expenses which he waived. He also testified that CCRA allows mechanics to deduct small tools priced at under $300, and the Court equates this to small computer items and telephone items for employees such as the Appellant as an investment advisor for CIBC - Wood Gundy. In the Court's view $300 plus sales tax in Saskatchewan, rounded, equals $350 respecting such items. The Appellant also argued that computer depreciation for someone such as he should be allowed; the Court agrees with him in principle, but the Income Tax Act is specific that employee's Capital Cost Allowance is only allowed for automobiles and aircraft (paragraph 8(1)(j)) and therefore the proper tax course is to lease such items (\"form matters\", Linden J.A.).\n[4] In particular, respecting small items in what might otherwise be described as \"capital\", they are prone to being lost, stolen or \"borrowed\" or to wearing out and for that reason are found to be analogous to \"small tools\". With respect to items like the donuts, that is a logical, goodwill gesture that will result in business being referred. It does not equate to a \"meal\", rather it is similar to dropping off a box of candy in the branch employees' coffee room.\n...\n[6] For 1999, the appeal is allowed respecting the following items of expenses claimed using dollar signs on pages 3 and 4 of the disallowed column in Exhibit A-5: $7.29, $3.21, $6.37, $2.50, $5.60, $5.60, $38, $150, $309.68, (In particular, the Appellant has no property interest), $129.90, $7.97, $22.59, (A radio claimed at $225.99 is regarded as personal by the Court), $316.38, $12.42, $22.79, $70.64, $45.59, total $1,156.53.\n[7] The Appellant raised the question as to whether he was an employee or in business in his work. The Court agrees that it is a legitimate question, but without seeing his employer's statements, documents and controls, and given the fact that at times the Appellant called himself an employee, the Court finds that he was an employee in 1998 and 1999.\n[8] The Court refers these findings to the Minister of National Revenue to reconsider and reassess the Appellant for the years in question to allow the additional expenses itemized herein; that is, for 1998, $1,273.52, for 1999, $1,147.53.\nSigned at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan this 24th day of April 2003.\n\"D.W.

She worked on a berry and vegetable farm from June to November, 2002 (period of employment). She was given a Record of Employment by RHD Farm Labour Contractor Ltd. (the payor) indicating that she had worked 1,080 insurable hours and had the amount of $8,985.84 in insurable earnings during the period of employment. The Minister of National Revenue originally determined that she was employed in insurable employment with the payor for only 948 insurable hours, with earnings of $7,885.84 from June 17, 2002 to November 2, 2002. She appealed that ruling and in response, the Minister determined that the Appellant was not employed by the payor.\n[3] The Minister relied on the following assumptions of fact:\na) the Payor was a farm labour contractor who provided labourers to Bisset Farms of Ladner and BC & Western Country Farms of Richmond;\n...\n[8] In an effort to reflect the reality of her situation, and after considering all of the evidence, and in particular that of Mr. Sandhu, whose informed judgment I accept, the appeal is allowed. The Appellant was employed in insurable employment with the payor during the period of employment and she had worked 948 insurable hours with income earned of $7,885.84.

The reassessments were based on paragraph 95(6)(b) of the of Income Tax Act, an anti-avoidance rule which forms part of the foreign affiliate provisions in the Act.\n[2] The issue in these appeals is whether paragraph 95(6)(b) applies to the acquisition of shares by the appellants in the non-resident corporation.\n[3] In reassessing the appellants, the Minister also relied on the General Anti?Avoidance Rule (the GAAR) in section 245 of the Act, but that position has now been abandoned.\n[4] Another issue raised by the pleadings, but which is now conceded by the respondent, has to do with the disallowance of a deduction taken by CBR Canada under section 112(1) of the Act for certain other dividends totaling $4,463,041 which it received in its 1997 taxation year. The respondent now concedes that CBR Canada is entitled to deduct those dividends.\nStatutory scheme\n[5] Paragraph 95(6)(b) is found in subdivision i of Division B of Part I of the Act, which deals with income from non-resident corporations.\n...\n[110] It follows that paragraph 95(6)(b) is not applicable to the appellants acquisition of the NAM LLC shares and the dividends received from NAM LLC are deductible to them under paragraph 113(1)(a).\n[111] For these reasons, the appeals are allowed.\n[112] At the end of the hearing of these appeals the respondents counsel requested the opportunity to make submissions on costs following the release of my reasons.

Miller J.\n[1] The issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant is entitled to deduct expenses of $6,630.03 and $9,987.66 for a home office in her 2007 and 2008 taxation years respectively.\nPreliminary motion\n[2] At the beginning of the hearing, the Respondent brought a motion to strike paragraphs 15(b), 15(d) and portions of paragraphs 14 and 16 in the Notice of Appeal. In those paragraphs, the Appellant sought relief from an assessment under the Excise Tax Act (ETA).\n[3] The Appellants income tax liability for her 2007 and 2008 taxation years was reassessed by notices dated November 29, 2012. This is her appeal of that reassessment which has been brought pursuant to section 169 of the Income Tax Act (ITA). Any decision that I make in this appeal can only be with respect to the reassessment issued under the ITA. In accordance with section 171 of the ITA, I can dismiss the appeal or I can allow the appeal and vacate the reassessment or vary the reassessment or refer the reassessment back to the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister) for reconsideration and reassessment. In other words, my decision in this appeal can only relate to the reassessment under the ITA.\n[4] The Appellant was reassessed by notice dated October 30, 2012 under the ETA. In order to challenge that reassessment, the Appellant should have brought an appeal under section 306 of that Act, which she has not.\n [...] \n[21] I have no doubt that the Appellant may have had an office in her home.

The Appellant company was incorporated on January 14, 2000, with the purpose of manufacturing luxury yachts of a particular type, I believe they were referred to as steel-hull boats. At all material times, there were a number of shareholders, the principal one being David Milgram who, if my calculation is correct, owned well over 50% of the shares. Upshon and his wife were also shareholders. At all relevant times, Milgram was the Chairman, Upshon was the President and his wife the Secretary of the Appellant. It is fair to say that almost all of the financing for the Appellant's business other than what was provided by some shareholders, came from Milgram.\n[3] Upshon was specifically hired as manager to oversee the construction of the first \"demonstration\" yacht and the subsequent production of other yachts because of his expertise in that particular field. In that capacity, he was responsible for the supervision of development and construction, as well as the hiring and dismissal of employees and all other matters that go hand in hand with his responsibilities as general manager. Upshon was paid a specific salary and was reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of his duties. He was not required to provide any material or equipment or tools or anything of that nature. All of the facilities were provided by the Appellant. And based on the evidence before the Court, he was required to provide regular progress reports specifically to Milgram.\n[4] I have concluded that the evidence clearly supports the Intervenor's and Minister's positions that Upshon was at all relevant times an employee of Ocean Ventures. Given the nature of the Intervenor's involvement, I would refer to what has been on occasion described as the organization or integration test. In Stevenson Jordan and Harrison, Ltd. v. Macdonald,[1] the Court said:\n...\nIn this particular appeal, I am satisfied that it was Ocean Ventures' business and not Upshon's. I will refer to one further decision, that of Cook J. in Market Investigations Ltd. v. Minister of Social Security.[3]He stated:\nThe observations of Lord Wright, of Denning L.J., and of the judges of the Supreme Court in the U.S.A. suggest that the fundamental test to be applied is this: 'Is the person who has engaged himself to perform these services performing them as a person in business on his own account?'. If the answer to that question is 'yes', then the contract is a contract for services. If the answer is 'no' then the contract is a contract of service.\nThe answer in the present appeal is that Upshon's contract was one of service and, therefore, the Appellant's case is untenable. The Minister's determination was correct, the Intervenor's position is upheld and the appeal is dismissed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 30th day of September, 2004.\n\"A.A.

First of all, there are confusing documents, confusing material, which you presented to the Court, for example.\n[2] There are certain documents, which if I can turn to them, documents which you originated and if I compare them, there are substantial differences.\n[3] For example, if I look at Exhibits R-1 and A-2, both documents that you prepared. One of them is addressed to a stranger. Exhibit A-2 would be a document prepared by a corporation known as Prospective Group Canada Limited and not 3040585 Canada Inc. The evidence is that Prospective Group Canada Limited does not exist.\n[4] 3040585 Canada Inc. carries on business, as I understand it, under the name of Prospective Group Canada.\n...\n[16]Now, I have observed the witness for the appellant and for the respondent, Mademoiselle Desprs. I found her a credible witness. I do not find you not credible. I think that over time, this has eaten into you. But at the same time, I think Revenue Qubec has tried to do something with these numbers, but it is very difficult when documents are sent to them without the proper names on them. You cannot expect strangers to try to work those numbers out. You have to help. You have to put things in order.\n[17]Based on what I have seen today, is that the records were not maintained in the manner required by the law. As you have to help yourself to get these credits and you have to keep things in proper order.\n[18]Unfortunately, sir, I am going to have to dismiss your appeal.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 9th day of June 2005.\n\"Gerald J.

The Appellant's objection and appeal are not with the accuracy of the Minister's calculations or interpretation of the Act. His position is that he was not advised by Canada Revenue Agency of the tax implications, even though CRA was aware of his purchase of past service. He adds that he was not aware of his RRSP contribution room until his 2003 return was assessed.\n[2] The Appellant had been employed by the Providence Health Care Society (PHCS) and, I believe, in 2003 was on secondment with a related union. In that year, he made registered pension plan contributions of $2,692 with respect to a pension plan established for employees of PHCS, and this amount was included on the Appellant's T4 information slips issued by PHCS.\n[3] The Appellant's unused RRSP deduction room at the end of 2002 was $395, and his earned income for RRSP purposes was $52,886. Also, his pension adjustment for 2002 was $5,329. In September of 2003, he bought back past service of a registered pension plan, at a total cost of $5,601.41, to provide for his retirement. The cost of buying back this past service was shared between the Appellant and his employer. The Appellant financed his share by transferring funds from his unmatured RRSP.\n[4] The Appellant did not receive a taxable benefit in 2003 when he directly transferred funds from his RRSP to buy back the past services. The past service of the RPP which the Appellant bought back covered the period May 25, 1999 to December 21, 2001. His past service pension plan adjustment for 2003 was $4,334 as a result of the buy back of RPP. The Appellant's RRSP deduction limit for 2003 was $251. The Appellant made RRSP contributions totalling $5,270 for the period March 4, 2003 to March 1, 2004, and the maximum he was entitled to contribute for the taxation year was $251.\n...\nThe applicant says that the law is unfair and he asked the Court to make an exception for him, however, the Court does not have that power. The Court must take the statute as it finds it. It is not open to the Court to make exceptions to statutory provisions on the grounds of fairness or equity. If the applicant considers the law unfair his remedy is with Parliament not the Court.\n[11] The Appellant's secondary argument is that a CRA officer advised him, during a telephone call on May 6, 2004, that an adjustment would correct the Appellant's return. The Appellant did not pursue this aggressively and, as counsel for the Respondent advised, estoppel cannot override the law (Bowman J. in Moulten v. the Queen, 2002 TCJ 80). As with Tax Court Judges, officers of CRA must take the Income Tax Act as they find it.\n[12] The appeal is dismissed.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 6th day of September, 2005.\n\"C.H.

The accountant who appeared as a witness on behalf of the Appellant agreed that these amounts were correct.\n[4] The whole matter is whether or not these amounts were properly categorized as a loan or indebtedness so that the Minister is entitled to apply the provisions of subsection 15(2) of the Income Tax Act.\n...\n[50] As counsel for the Respondent said, there was an extensive review of the workings of the corporation made over a period of years, not just the years in question, not only by the Appellant's bookkeeper but also by the accountant who testified on behalf of the Canada Revenue Agency here today, and the Court can find no reason for disputing that evidence.\n[51] This evidence was given in a straightforward manner. He showed the Court his working papers and explained to the Court how he came up with the figures that he did. There was no dispute with the figures themselves, and the Court can do nothing but conclude that the Appellant has not rebutted the presumptions contained in the Reply.\n[52] The Appellant has not established on a balance of probabilities that the Minister's assessment was incorrect.

By assessment dated December 1, 2003, the Minister of National Revenue (the \"Minister\") disallowed the Amount for the Appellant's 2002 taxation year.\n6. The Appellant objected to the assessment by serving on the Minister a Notice of Objection on January 13, 2004.\n...\n3. The Appellant testified that his wife asked or told him to move out at the end of 2001 and indicated that his relationship with his wife was at various times chancy or subject to similar outbursts. At best, this would indicate that at times he sojourned outside the matrimonial home. But his wife did not testify.\n[5] As a result, the Appellant did not meet the onus upon him to establish that in 2002 he maintained a self-contained domestic establishment separate from his wife. The Court does not believe his assertions that he did so. In particular, there was no evidence corroborating his statements to that effect even though he had been warned by CRA that such corroboration was necessary.\n[6] For this reason, the appeal is dismissed.\nSigned at Calgary, Alberta, this 10th day of February 2005.\n\"D.W.

            "input": "McArthur J.\n[1] This is an appeal from a decision by the Minister of National Revenue for the 1999 taxation year; 2000 is withdrawn. The Minister submits that the Appellant was not usually required to perform his job duties outside his employer's place of business or at various locations under paragraph 8(h)(1) of the Income Tax Act pursuant to income tax. Consequently, subsection 8(2) of the Act precludes the Appellant from deducting his travel expenses.\n[2] In computing his income for 1999, the Appellant deducted ten thousand three hundred ninety?five dollars ($10,395.00) for motor vehicle travel expenses. The following facts, which I find in paragraph 10 of the Reply to the Notice of Appeal, are not in dispute. At all relevant times, the Appellant was employed by Crown Camp Services Limited, the employer. The Appellant was not usually required to perform his job duties outside his employer's place of business or at various locations. The employer's place of business was PTL Lodge.\n[3] The Appellant lived in Fort McMurray, Alberta. PTL Lodge was located seventy (70) kilometres from the Appellant's home. The Appellant travelled from his home to his place of work every day. The Appellant is requesting permission to deduct his car expenses. He lives in Fort McMurray with his wife and his seventeen? (17) year old daughter. He drives one hundred forty (140) kilometres daily to and from PTL Lodge, where he works as a cook. His hours of work are from 2:00 to 11:30 in the morning. The Lodge is a residence and restaurant, I believe, particularly for those working on the Tar Sands projects. There is no village between Fort McMurray and his place of work. Otherwise, he would move there with his family. He says that it is a dangerous highway, especially in the winter, and winters are long in this part of the world.\n[4] In order to deduct car expenses, the Appellant must meet the conditions set out in paragraph 8(1)(h). Moreover, a taxpayer was usually required to perform work duties elsewhere than at the employer's place of business. The place of business of the Appellant's employer was the Lodge. He was not required to travel elsewhere. He simply travelled from his home to his place of work. While I share the Appellants frustration, I would be stretching the interpretation of paragraph 8(1)(h) too far by granting his request.\n[5] I found the Appellant to be scrupulously honest, almost to a fault. He did not colour his evidence to his own advantage. He told the facts as he understood them and asked for fairness. This is an appeal I would like to allow. But to do so would be to ignore the wording of subparagraph 8(1)(h)(i) and change the legislation. I have no discretion to do so.\n[6] The Appellant may be well advised to speak to his Member of Parliament. The appeal is dismissed.\n...\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 17th day of June 2004.\n\"C.

            "input": "(Delivered orally from the bench on April 30, 2008, in Toronto, Ontario.)\nMargeson, J.\n[1] The sole issue before the court is whether the Appellant, during the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 is entitled to claim a gross non-refundable tax credit in relation to an amount for an eligible dependant, with respect to his son Alexander for each of the 2003, 2004, 2005 taxation years.\n[2] The Court is satisfied that the Appellant himself, on the basis of his evidence and what he has told the Court, is quite aware of the fact that unless certain requirements are met which, according to his evidence, have not been met, which would evoke a change in the separation agreement entered into, that he is prohibited under the Statute from claiming the deduction which he seeks.\n[3] Legally speaking, on the basis of the law, hes not arguing that he is entitled to the deduction that he seeks, that is on the basis of 118(1)(b) and sub-sections 56.1(4), 60.1(4) and 18(5) and 52(3.1) and 152(4) of the Income Tax Act (Act). The Court is satisfied that he himself realizes that on the facts of the case the deduction by him is not permissible. That is the state of the law at the present time.\n[4] With respect to the cases that have been referred to, Chief Justice Bowman has dealt with this matter, and Justice Woods has dealt with this matter. Bowman C.J., in the case of Hamilton v. R., (2007) C.T.C. 145, (2007) C.T.C. 22, had basically the same factual situation before him, although as the Appellant himself points out, how the parties got before the Court  the reason for the parties getting before the Court was different. In this case, the Appellant says that he was directed or at least encouraged by the people from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to make the claim, whereas in the Hamilton case, supra, it was completely on the Appellants own initiative that she made the application.\n[5] In any event, that is not significant as far as the Court is concerned. That may be the reason, although I cant do anything about that, but the importance or significance of the case that Bowman C.J. dealt with (and in which he refers to an earlier case by Justice Woods in Irwin v. R. [2005] 1 C.T.C. 2114 [Informal Procedure]) is that there is an obvious unfairness for separated or divorced parents with respect to joint custody of children.\n...\n[17] Unfortunately for the Appellant, the Court cannot grant the relief that he seeks. The law is clear that he was not entitled, in the years in question, to claim the amount that he seeks. Whether he is entitled to do it in the future will depend upon whether a Court should be able to decide that he is no longer or will not longer be required to pay the support amount here.\n[18] During the years under appeal he certainly was required to pay the support.\n[19] The Court will have to dismiss the appeal and confirm the Ministers assessment.\nSigned at New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, this 19th day of July 2008.\nT.

When he filed his tax returns for those years Mr. Dnebosky deducted various expenses from his employment income. The Minister of National Revenue denied the deduction of those expenses and Mr. Dnebosky has appealed that denial. I am going to give my oral judgment on the appeals at this time. I will not be issuing written reasons for judgment.\n[2] I heard the testimony and cross-examination of Mr. Dnebosky. Except as noted below, I found him to be a credible witness.\n[3] The key issue in this case is whether the denied expenses should be allowed or not. I will deal with each category of expenses separately.\n[4] Turning first to the accounting fees, Mr. Dnebosky deducted $160, $160 and $200 in accounting fees in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. While there are circumstances where accounting fees may be a deductible expense for tax purposes, they are never deductible as employment expenses. Accordingly, I find\n[5] that Mr. Dnebosky's deduction of those fees was properly disallowed by the Minister.\n...\n[35] Finally, turning to supplies, Mr. Dnebosky deducted $1,191 as supplies expenses in 2014. He did not provide receipts for these expenses either. I would deny them on the same basis that I have denied the office expenses. In addition, the types of supplies that Mr. Dnebosky described in his testimony were, for the most part, not things that I would have expected his employers would have required him to provide.\n[36] Based on all of the foregoing, the appeals are dismissed.\nThis Amended Reasons for Judgment is issued in substitution of the Reasons for Judgment dated April 12, 2019.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada, this 4th day of June 2019.\nDavid E.

I heard this appeal yesterday.\n[2] On September 6, 2007, the Appellant executed a contract for the purchase of a condominium unit located at 207-6375 Whiskey Jack Road, Big White, British Columbia, from the vendors, Don Bigelow and his spouse, Frances Solmundson. The purchase was completed in late 2007. The Appellant purchased the unit to use personally as his residence. According to the purchasers statement of adjustments, the Appellant paid Goods and Services Tax, which I will refer to throughout as GST, of 6 percent in respect to this transaction in an amount equal to $8,340.00. According to the contract of Purchase and Sale, the Appellant acknowledged that the sale of this property was not GST exempt and that he would be responsible for paying any applicable GST in respect to the purchase price of $139,000.00.\n[3] The evidence of Don Bigelow, one of the vendors, was that he purchased this property in early 2005 and applied for and received a GST registration number in December of 2004. He testified that the property was purchased as a ski rental unit, with Okanogan Vacation Rentals looking after the rental of the unit for the vendors. The vendors never resided in the condominium and Mr. Bigelow referred to it as an investment property. Some improvements were made to the unit prior to its sale in 2007 to the Appellant. Throughout the vendors ownership, rental income was declared, GST collected and remitted and input tax credits claimed. The rentals were short term, according to Mr. Bigelows evidence, and averaged seven to ten days.\n[4] According to correspondence from the solicitor, dated December 7, 2007, the Appellant was advised that, pursuant to information received from the GST rulings department, GST was payable by the Appellant on the condominium purchase price, but he would still be eligible to apply for the New Housing Rebate because the property had been converted from commercial use to residential use. On December 11, 2007, the Appellant did apply for the New Housing Rebate and he successfully claimed a rebate of $3,002.40, based on the purchase price of $139,000.00.\n[5] On January 15, 2008, the Appellant submitted a general application for rebate of GST in which he requested a rebate of the entire amount of GST paid on this purchase as an amount that was paid by him in error. Although the Appellant successfully claimed the New Housing Rebate, the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister) denied the Appellants general application for rebate of GST.\n...\n[10] The Appellant did not adduce evidence that could demolish the assumptions upon which the Minister relied and upon which the assessment was based.\n[11] Although the Respondent presented several alternative arguments in the event that this Court might conclude that the property was a residential complex, since I have determined that the condominium unit was not a residential complex at the time of the purchase by the Appellant, I see no need to deal with the several alternative arguments in light of my conclusions.\n[12] The appeal is therefore dismissed without costs.\nSigned at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, this 8th day of July 2011.\nDiane Campbell\nCampbell J.\n",

By those assessments the Minister of National Revenue assessed the appellant as a resident of Canada. The appellant's position is that he ceased to be a resident of Canada in 1993 and that in the years under appeal he was a resident of the Turks and Caicos Islands (\"TCI\") and not a resident of Canada.\n[2] The respondent concedes that the appellant was a resident of the TCI in the years in question but contends that he was also a resident of Canada. Canada has no income tax convention with TCI. Therefore the rules set out in Canada's income tax treaties with respect to persons with dual residency have no application. It is possible for a person to be a resident of Canada for Canadian income tax purposes while at the same time being a resident of another country.\n[3] An individual can be a resident of Canada for the purposes of the Income Tax Act either because of meeting one of the deeming provisions in subsection 250(1) of the Income Tax Act, (such as sojourning in Canada for 183 days or more) or by reason of falling within subsection 250(3) which reads:\n(3) In this Act, a reference to a person resident in Canada includes a person who was at the relevant time ordinarily resident in Canada.\n[4] The use of the word \"includes\" in subsection 250(3) seems to imply that there could be a third (undefined) category of Canadian resident who is neither deemed under subsection 250(1) to be a resident of Canada nor \"ordinarily resident\" within the meaning of subsection 250(3). It is not clear just what the characteristics of such a form of residency might be. No basis has been demonstrated in any event for concluding that the appellant falls within this narrow but undefined category.\n[5] At all events, the Minister pleaded a number of assumptions. Some of them are irrelevant in light of the respondent's concession that the appellant was resident in TCI in the years in question. Others are as consistent with non-residency as residency, that is to say, they do not point in any direction. Many are undisputed. The assumptions as pleaded are as follows:\n...\n(b) if the parties agree on the basis of allocation I could incorporate this agreement into the judgment;\n(c) I could hear further evidence and argument on the question of allocation.\n[38] I shall defer signing the formal judgment for two weeks until I hear from counsel.\nSigned at Ottawa, Canada this 30th day of November 2006.\n\"D.G.H.

The Appellant was represented by Grald Melanson, a customs specialist with Tower Group International Inc.\n[2] The facts briefly are as follows. The Tower Group, a brokerage firm, in error paid GST in the amount of $2,470 upon the import of meat products. It is my understanding that Tower Group's client was London Foods. The matter became somewhat confused in that Hallmark, the Appellant, had the quotas for the chicken and ribs that were imported and they are noted as the legal party, and the Appellant is in the business of processing poultry and was the importer of record for this transaction.\n[3] The Tower Group attempted to re-correct the error and obtain its $2,470 through the London Group and finally through the Appellant, Hallmark. The application was first made through London Foods. London Foods having no financial interest in seeing that the money was refunded did not cooperate. Hallmark, upon request of the Tower Group, then made application outside the two-year limit provided for in subsection 261(3) of the Act.\n[4] There is no doubt that the meat products were exempt and the $2,470 was not exigible. Mr. Melanson very fairly presented the case evidence on behalf of the Appellant and entered a bundle of documents as Exhibit A-1. He has no argument with the assumptions in the Reply to the Notice of Appeal. His position is that he and the London Group were misled by the officers of the Revenue Canada dealing with GST in reply to London Foods' first application and that on compassionate and equitable grounds, his company should receive the $2,470.\n...\nFirm:\nN/A\nFor the Respondent:\nMorris Rosenberg\nDeputy Attorney General of Canada\nOttawa, Canada\n",

The research that was involved in preparing these cases and the other work involved in the preparation of the cases certainly was enlightened by the fact that the Appellants were members of the same School Board and the problem that existed was the same for each one.
