If AT&T's request for a Vendor audit or inspection arises from, in AT&T's good faith opinion, materially or consistently deficient Service provided by the Subcontractor under AT&T's account, and the audit in both Parties' opinions confirms such deficiencies, Vendor shall not charge AT&T a fee for the Vendor's audit of its Subcontractor. (iii) If Vendor's contract with its applicable Subcontractor does not allow Vendor access to the facilities and systems of Subcontractor required to conduct the audit described in Subsection (b) above, then Vendor shall provide a list of such Subcontractors and the services being provided by such Subcontractor to AT&T for its review.
